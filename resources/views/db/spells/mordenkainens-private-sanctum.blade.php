<p>You make an area within range magically secure. The area is a cube that can be as small as 5 feet to as large as 100 feet on each side. The spell lasts for the duration or until you use an action to dismiss it.</p>
<p>When you cast the spell, you decide what sort of security the spell provides, choosing any or all of the following properties:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Sound can't pass through the barrier at the edge of the warded area.</li>
    <li>The barrier of the warded area appears dark and foggy, preventing vision (including darkvision) through it.</li>
    <li>Sensors created by divination spells can't appear inside the protected area or pass through the barrier at its perimeter.</li>
    <li>Creatures in the area can't be targeted by divination spells.</li>
    <li>Nothing can teleport into or out of the warded area.</li>
    <li>Planar travel is blocked within the warded area.</li>
</ul>
<p>Casting this spell on the same spot every day for a year makes this effect permanent.</p>
