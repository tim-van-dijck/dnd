<p>Choose one or more of the following types of creatures: celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, or undead. The circle affects a creature of the chosen type in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
    <li> The creature can't willingly enter the cylinder by nonmagical means. If the creature tries to use teleportation or interplanar travel to do so, it must first succeed on a charisma saving throw.</li>
    <li> The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls against targets within the cylinder.</li>
    <li> Targets within the cylinder can't be charmed, frightened, or possessed by the creature.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you cast this spell, you can elect to cause its magic to operate in the reverse direction, preventing a creature of the specified type from leaving the cylinder and protecting targets outside it.</p>
