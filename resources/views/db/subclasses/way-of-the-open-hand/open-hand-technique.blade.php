<p>You can manipulate your enemy's ki when you harness your own. Whenever you hit a creature with one of the attacks granted by your Flurry of Blows, you can impose one of the following effects on that target:</p>
<ul>
    <li>It must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.</li>
    <li>It must make a Strength saving throw. If it fails, you can push it up to 15 feet away from you.</li>
    <li>It can't take reactions until the end of your next turn.</li>
</ul>
